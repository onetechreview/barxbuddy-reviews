<p class="mb-0">I tried out the dog-training tool that supposedly puts a stop to annoying barking, unwelcomed jumping, the constant digging, and house-destroying chewing&mdash;no painful prong or shock collars needed!</p>

<p>It was another sunny summer day in the suburbs of St. Louis and I was taking my 2-year-old rescue pup, Banjo, on his afternoon walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk&rdquo; would be the nice way to put it.</p>
<p>What really happened was me getting dragged around my neighborhood by my 50-lb lab mutt who tried to chase every squirrel up a tree, bark at every passing dog, and lunge at every jogger running by.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t aggressive. Really, he just wanted to play with all the dogs he saw and lick everyone&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>I found myself trying to convince my neighbors of this to cover up my pup&rsquo;s poor behavior. &ldquo;He just wants to play! He&rsquo;s still a puppy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;ve ever been on the other side of these situations, you can never really be sure if a dog you don&rsquo;t know is coming at you with a &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; lick or an &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; lunge. And as the owner, it feels embarrassing.</p>
<p>Sure, I was tired of being pulled around and feeling out of control. But I was more tired of seeing my neighbors cross to the other side of the street and the mailman hightail it to his truck whenever they saw Banjo and me coming.</p>
<p>My heart was breaking. Banjo was such a sweet boy and just wanted to love up on people. But he&rsquo;d come from the streets and had zero &ldquo;formal&rdquo; training prior to me adopting him.</p>
<p>I certainly wasn&rsquo;t helping the situation, and I knew it. But I didn&rsquo;t feel right about using those medieval prong collars or shock devices on my sweet boy that were coming up when I Google searched how to solve this problem!</p>
<p>Then one day, I took Banjo to the local dog park to try and tire him out, hoping that would calm him down a bit.</p>
<p>There were plenty of other &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; dogs running around, wrestling, jumping up on the picnic tables, and barking at every new dog that came through the gate.</p>
<p class="mb-0">But in the back corner, I noticed a man playing fetch with his two German shepherds. They were paying attention to his every command and ignoring everything else going on in the park.</p>
<img src="img/d3.png" srcset="/V200m/app/desktop/images/new_lander/d3@2x.png 2x, /V200m/app/desktop/images/new_lander/d3@3x.png 3x " class="img-fluid my-4" alt="#" />
<p>I noticed he had a little device in his hand that he occasionally put in front of his dogs, causing them to sit and wait patiently at his feet on command.</p>
<p>I got curious about how this man was commanding total control over these well-behaved dogs, and I approached him to ask his &ldquo;secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man introduced himself as Steve, and turns out he was a highly sought-after dog trainer who was regularly recruited by police and service dog centers around the country to train their dogs and instruct their trainers!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering about that little device he was using, it&rsquo;s called <span class="font-bold">BarxBuddy</span>.</p>
<h2 class="h-text mt-4">What Is the BarxBuddy?</h2>
<div class="h-line"></div>
<img src="img/div1.png" srcset="/V200m/app/desktop/images/new_lander/div1@2x.png 2x, /V200m/app/desktop/images/new_lander/div1@3x.png 3x " class="img-fluid my-4" alt="#" />
<p>It&rsquo;s a tool the size of a small TV remote that uses sound waves to break your dog&rsquo;s attention and calm them down&mdash;PAIN-FREE! (Unlike those shock collars and devices that dig into your puppy&rsquo;s skin.)</p>
<p>Steve told me about this concept of how he trained all of his dogswith BarxBuddy called, &ldquo;Train, Treat, Repeat&rdquo; or TTR.</p>
<p>It works like this&hellip;</p>
<p>Anytime your dog does something unruly, you use the BarxBuddy to get his attention. (Your dog can hear the ultrasonic sound waves, but you can&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>Then, you give a firm command like &ldquo;DOWN&rdquo; and give him a treat once he obeys.</p>
<p>Steve explained that just correcting your dog isn&rsquo;t enough. You have to reward the good behavior so they know what to do next time. Then you repeat this process of &ldquo;positive reinforcement&rdquo; over and over again.</p>
<p class="mb-0">This man had trained hundreds of dogs and said that &ldquo;Train, Treat, Repeat&rdquo; was his go-to method for all the dogs he&rsquo;d worked with.</p>
<img src="img/ttr.svg" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="#" />
<p>Still, this guy had been training different breeds of dogs for decades. I thought there had to be more to his method than the simple click of a button. I remained skeptical.</p>
<p>Later that week, I had a few friends over for dinner. Banjo &ldquo;greeted&rdquo; each of them at the door with his typical jumping and licking routine. And of course, not to my surprise, it persisted once we&rsquo;d all sat down at the table.</p>
<p>I told them about my experience at the dog park, meeting Steve, and this magical little device he was using.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, my best friend said, &ldquo;Oh, you mean the BarxBuddy? That&rsquo;s how I trained my dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My eyes lit up. I was bewildered. How was it that I&rsquo;d never heard of this thing before, and now within a single week a stranger at the dog park and my own best friend were singing its praises?!</p>
<p>After my guests left that night and Banjo enjoyed his nighttime routine of jumping up and down on the couch and running around in circles, I sat down to do some research.</p>
<p>I saw over 1,600 positive reviews from happy customers with dogs just like Banjo who had used the BarxBuddy to finally put an end to their excessive barking, jumping, and chewing.</p>
<p>Just like me, many of these people didn&rsquo;t like the idea of using painful pinching or shocking devices on their fur babies and loved the PAIN-FREE alternative offered from the BarxBuddy.</p>
<p class="clr-gd font-bold f-16 f-pop">Plus, it had a RISK-FREE Money Back 30-Day Guarantee, so I figured I had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>I decided to pull the trigger. I ordered the BarxBuddy from their website along with a bag of treats created specifically for the &ldquo;Treat&rdquo; portion of TTR (both are only available online).</p>
<p>In a couple of days, Banjo alerted me to its arrival when he started barking at the mailman and scratching at the front door.</p>
<p>I told him, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the LAST TIME you do that, Banjo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was time to see this thing in action.</p>
<h2 class="h-text mt-4">So&hellip; Did It Really Work?</h2>
<div class="h-line"></div>
<p class="mt-4">I decided to pull the trigger. I ordered the BarxBuddy from their website along with a bag of treats created specifically for the &ldquo;Treat&rdquo; portion of TTR (both are only available online).</p>
<p>In a couple of days, Banjo alerted me to its arrival when he started barking at the mailman and scratching at the front door.</p>
<p>I told him, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the LAST TIME you do that, Banjo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was time to see this thing in action.</p>
<p>I had the box opened before the mailman had even pulled away from the end of my driveway.</p>
<p>Banjo was still barking and, without even looking at the instructions, I pointed the BarxBuddy at him and pushed the button.</p>
<p>Banjo stopped barking immediately and looked at me with a quizzical look. I would have loved to have seen the look on my face, because I was actually surprised.</p>
<p>I remembered what the dog trainer had shared at the park about how to use it, so in a firm voice I said, &ldquo;DOWN&rdquo; and pointed to the ground.</p>
<p>Banjo obeyed and sat right down.</p>
<p>I then reached over to the counter, ripped open the bag of treats that I&rsquo;d purchased along with the device, handed Banjo a treat, and told him, &ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="font-bold">At that moment, I felt like I had control over my dog for the first time ever.</p>
<p>But the &ldquo;work&rdquo; had just begun.</p>
<p>I had the BarxBuddy within reach every day at home and always carried it with me on our walks and trips to the dog park.</p>
<p>Anytime Banjo started pulling, barking, or jumping on strangers, I just pointed the device and pressed the button.</p>
<p>Every time, without fail, the bad behavior stopped.</p>
<p>After every push of the button, I&rsquo;d tell Banjo, &ldquo;DOWN&rdquo; (you can use SIT, HEEL, or the command of your choice) and give him one of the treats to reward his good behavior.</p>
<p>And get this&hellip; instead of crossing to the other side of the street or rushing back to their front doors, my neighbors started commenting on what a good boy Banjo was! (And this all happened in just a few weeks from when we started with this new training.)</p>
<p>After training with the BarxBuddy, Banjo learned to sit and wait patiently as other people and dogs passed by.</p>
<p>He stopped lunging, he stopped jumping up to lick faces, and he even stopped chasing squirrels!</p>
<p>You know how most dog owners say, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a good boy?&rdquo; to their pup?</p>
<p>For me, the REAL answer now is actually Banjo!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a dog owner, it only takes a minute or two to notice the difference between a well-trained dog and an unruly one. The truth is, it all comes down to the dog owner and what he/she does (or doesn&rsquo;t do) to train them.</p>
<p>But when you find something that actually solves your problem and makes the process so easy to do, you want to share it with every dog owner out there!</p>
<p class="mb-0">That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so happy to write about my experience using BarxBuddy and share it with you.</p>
<img src="img/d4.png" srcset="/V200m/app/desktop/images/new_lander/d4@2x.png 2x, /V200m/app/desktop/images/new_lander/d4@3x.png 3x " class="img-fluid my-4" alt="#" />
<h2 class="h-text mt-2">How Exactly Does the BarxBuddy Work?</h2>
<div class="h-line"></div>
<p class="mt-4">Most other dog training devices are designed to &ldquo;force&rdquo; your dog into correcting his behavior. And there&rsquo;s a reason they usually don&rsquo;t work!</p>
<p>The pain and discomfort of prong collars and shock collars don&rsquo;t correct bad behavior. They just train your dog to accept punishment.</p>
<p>The BarxBuddy emits a high-frequency sound that&rsquo;s an annoyance to dogs but doesn&rsquo;t actually cause them harm.</p>
<p>The ultrasonic sound waves get their attention and allow you to use the &ldquo;Train, Treat, Repeat&rdquo; or TTR process to correct unwanted behaviors without raising your voice, touching your dog, or inflicting any pain.</p>
<p class="font-bold">Ultrasonic Sound Waves + the TTR process = ZERO PAIN &amp; IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.</p>
<p>It offers two strength settings: 1 for training your dog and 2 for deterring aggressive dogs (which was a nice added feature I wasn&rsquo;t expecting). It also emits a bright LED light to offer an additional way to get a dog&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Combining this completely safe device with the positive reinforcement of the treats using the &ldquo;Train, Treat, Repeat&rdquo; method is the single most effective training technique I&rsquo;ve ever tried.</p>
<h2 class="h-text mt-4">How Easy Is It to Use?</h2>
<div class="h-line"></div>
<p class="mt-4">If you can push the button on your TV remote, you can use the BarxBuddy.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of harnesses and collars that require you to get your dog to sit still BEFORE you can even put the thing on him, only to potentially cause discomfort and pain&hellip; you can start using the BarxBuddy straight out of the box without touching your dog.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I never felt good about putting something on my dog that could potentially hurt him. It just feels wrong.</p>
<p>With BarxBuddy, all you have to do is press the button, say your command, and &ldquo;Train, Treat, Repeat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel really good about that!</p>
<h2 class="h-text mt-4">A Few Other Things I LOVE About This Device:</h2>
<div class="h-line"></div>
<div class="txt4 mt-4">
<p>It&rsquo;s small enough to fit into your pocket&hellip; you can take it with you anywhere!</p>
<p>It has a lanyard attached to it that you can loop around your wrist or use to hang the device from your belt, backpack, or purse.</p>
<p>The ultrasonic sound is irresistible to ANY dog&hellip; even overly aggressive ones and dogs who don&rsquo;t stop barking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 100% safe and harmless to both dogs and humans.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need to own a dog to use it&hellip; it&rsquo;s great for everyday walkers and joggers worried about a run-in with an aggressive dog!</p>
<p>BarxBuddy stands behind their product! Don&rsquo;t love it? Send it back for a full refund. (Trust me, you won&rsquo;t want to!)</p>
<p>The BarxBuddy costs less than just one dog-training class! And you can use it as much as needed. Plus, renowned dog trainers swear by it!</p>
<p>After just a couple weeks of using it, I&rsquo;ve noticed I don&rsquo;t even need to press the button anymore! Just by reaching for the BarxBuddy my dog has learned to sit and wait patiently for his treat.</p>
<p class="mb-0">The BarxBuddy treats you can purchase along with the device are the perfect size for training virtually any breed of dog&hellip; and Banjo loves them! I bet your dog will love them too.</p>

<h2 class="h-text">How Much Is The BarxBuddy?</h2>
<div class="h-line"></div>
<p class="mt-4">BarxBuddy is made to fit any dog owner&rsquo;s budget.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re like most dog owners, you&rsquo;ll do anything for your pup and likely agree that your dog&rsquo;s well-being is priceless.</p>

<p>For a limited time, you can get the BarxBuddy device PLUS a 30-day supply of training treats for HALF OFF the regular price.</p>
<p>Normally, this set would cost $110. But when you try it today with the special savings deal available right now, you can get the kit with both the BarxBuddy and the training treats for just $49.95! (PLUS, Free Shipping and the peace of mind knowing you are protected by their 30-Day Risk-Free Money Back Guarantee!)</p>

<a href="https://www.edlwss.com/938L6R1/4LWQFDN/?uid=12441"><img src="img/cta-btn.svg" class="img-fluid my-4 grw" alt="#" /></a>
<p class="mt-3">You also have the option to purchase 2, 3, or 4 BarxBuddy devices at once for even more savings.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased several more devices since my first one. I keep one connected to Banjo&rsquo;s leash, one in the kitchen, and one in the glovebox of my car (just in case).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also given a few to friends and neighbors as gifts to try out with their own fur babies!</p>
<p>Plus, I keep ordering the treats&hellip; Banjo loves them!</p>
<p>For two years, I had been one of those dog owners that gets &ldquo;walked&rdquo; (aka pulled around) by their dog, instead of doing the walking as the owner in charge.</p>
<p>And if I hadn&rsquo;t discovered the BarxBuddy, that pattern probably would have persisted for the rest of Banjo&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m truly proud to be the owner of a well-behaved dog who doesn&rsquo;t go a day without hearing a compliment for being a &ldquo;good boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This device is so easy to use, and the &ldquo;Train, Treat, Repeat&rdquo; method works every time Banjo slips up with his behavior (which is rare these days!).</p>
<p>If you know your dog could use the help of this positive reinforcement training OR are tired and embarrassed of being pulled around and feeling out of control of your dog&rsquo;s behavior, there&rsquo;s really no reason not to try the BarxBuddy device and treats.</p>
<p>Just do what I did and order the device + treats to get the SPECIAL DEAL and FREE SHIPPING!</p>
<p>Today you can join the thousands of satisfied dog owners&mdash;including me &mdash;who have used the BarxBuddy to train their dog the easy way&mdash;PAIN- FREE.</p>
<p>Order BarxBuddy right now, and within a week or two you&rsquo;ll finally have the answer to the question &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a good dog?&rdquo;... because it&rsquo;ll be your pup!</p>
